How to tap into this advantage as a Customer Service Manager? One practical tool in achieving a smooth onboarding process is a Customer Portal.</p>

            "Onboarding isn't just the first step in a journey with a new customer; it's the first impression you leave. A thoughtfully designed, customer-centric onboarding process can be the difference between a short-lived transaction and a long-term partnership."

        <h2>The Role of Onboarding</h2>   
        <p>The onboarding stage is the dawn of a new relationship between your client and your company. It's a crucial period where the customer gains insights into the product and your company's ethos, values, and processes.</p>
        <p>Here, the CS team wears multiple hats:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Guiding the customer through product exploration, setting them up for success.</li>
          <li>Cultivating a relationship with the customer, introducing them to your company's unique culture, people, and protocols.</li>
        </ol>
